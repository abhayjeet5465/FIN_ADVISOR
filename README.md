# 📊 FIN_ADVISOR — Personalized Financial Investment Advisor

FIN_ADVISOR is a **Large Language Model–powered financial advisory system** designed to generate **personalized Indian stock market investment recommendations**. The project demonstrates end-to-end fine-tuning of a modern LLM using **LoRA adapters**, efficient quantization, and real-world finance data.

This repository focuses on practical LLM engineering rather than UI, showcasing how domain-specific intelligence can be built on top of a general-purpose foundation model.

## Overview

The system fine-tunes **Meta LLaMA-3 (3B Instruct)** on a curated combination of public finance instruction datasets and a custom Indian finance dataset. By learning instruction–response patterns related to investing, risk appetite, and portfolio construction, the model can respond like a context-aware financial advisor.

The goal of FIN_ADVISOR is not prediction, but **reasoned financial guidance** using natural language, making it suitable for advisory assistants, research tools, or educational platforms.

## How It Works

The workflow begins by loading a public finance instruction dataset from Hugging Face and combining it with a custom CSV containing Indian finance-specific data. Both datasets are normalized into a common `instruction`–`response` format and shuffled to ensure balanced learning.

A **4-bit quantized LLaMA-3 model** is then loaded using Unsloth, allowing the training process to run efficiently on limited GPU resources such as Google Colab. To avoid full fine-tuning costs, **LoRA adapters** are attached to key attention and MLP layers, enabling parameter-efficient learning.

The model is trained using Hugging Face’s `Trainer` with gradient accumulation and an 8-bit optimizer for stability. After training, the LoRA adapters are saved separately and also merged into the base model to produce a standalone fine-tuned checkpoint. Both the adapters and the merged model can be pushed to the Hugging Face Hub for reuse or deployment.

Finally, the trained model is used for inference by prompting it with real-world investment questions, such as portfolio allocation based on capital size and risk tolerance.

## Example Interaction

**Instruction:**  
Suggest an Indian stock portfolio for ₹2 lakh for a medium-risk investor.

**Response:**  
The model generates a diversified portfolio with sectoral balance, rationale, and capital allocation tailored to the given constraints.
